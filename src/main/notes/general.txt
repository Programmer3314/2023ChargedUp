I think we should "immediately" create a Subsystem that is dedicated to tracking our field position.
This should integrate all of the sources our robot will have to detect location. 
The drivetrain odometry may be able to be moved to the NavigationSubsystem. The AprilTag detection
would also be integrated. The navx could be integrated as well. 
Once this is done and we have a field position available from the NavigationSubsystem, we should start
thinking about navigating based on target field position. For example, we will need to navigate to grid
stations. We should be able to do this (while dodging the charging station) from anywhere in the community.
We should be able to drive to a loading station fully autonomously even in teleop (assuming no robot 
interferance).
One key element will be initializing the odometry with it's initial position. If we can see a tag, 
that should solve the problem, but if we can't, we might need a "standard" starting position.
